%Solving for a water tower which is a cylinder attached to the base portion of an upside down cone, height given as 20 meters

% Specify the variables needed to solve this problem, all variables are given 
%diametercyl, radiuscyl, heightcyl are used for the cylinder
%diametercone, radiuscone, radcone, etc are used for the cone 
diametercyl = 25
radiuscyl = diametercyl/2
heightcyl = 19

diametercone = 46
radiuscone = 23
radcone = radiuscyl
heightcone = 14
heightcone20 = 1

% Specify the height of the water
h = 20

% Computing volume of cylinder and cone
vcyl = pi*radiuscyl^2*heightcyl
vcone = (1/3*pi*1*radiuscone)*.07
v = vcone + vcyl

% Specifications, formatting, calling to function
formatSpec = 'Volume of the cylinder is %4.2f and the volume of the cone is %8.3f (in meters cubed)';
fprintf(formatSpec,vcyl,vcone)

function [vcyl, vcone] = volumeofweirdassobject(h)

% Given parameters 
diametercyl = 25
radiuscyl = diametercyl/2
diametercone = 46
radiuscone = diametercone/2
prompt = ('What is the height')
(h) == input(prompt)
if h <= 19
    vcyl = pi*radiuscyl^2*(h)
else h > 19
    vcone = pi*radiuscone^2*((h)/3)  
end
