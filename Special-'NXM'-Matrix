% A function that returns an n x m matrix with specific values
% The value of each element in the first row is the number of the column.
% The value of each element in the first column is the number of the row.
% The rest of the elements each has a value equal to the sum of the element above it and element to the left.

function [A] = specialMatrix(n,m)

% Prevents too many inputs, prechecks
if nargin >2 
    error ('Too many inputs')
end 

if nargin <2
    error ('Not enough inputs')
end 

% Sets up the matrix in accordance to the provided values
A = ones(n,m)

% Counts the amount in the columns/rows and fills them in
% Essentially saying 'Hey this is how many I have in the row and column.', feels a touch self-contradictory in a weird way.
A(1,:) = 1:m
A(:,1) = 1:n

end


% Calls to function
n = 4; m = 5;
specialMatrix(n,m)
